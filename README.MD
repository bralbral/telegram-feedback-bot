## Usage

Messages with an available [content type](./src/bot/handlers/users.py#L19) will be transfered to admin group or admin chat.

*(See variable `chat_id` from [config.yaml](./deploy/example.config.yaml#L6))*

If the transfer is successful, the requesting party will be notified.

Admin can answer to message by reply. The answer will be sent to the person who asked.

If the transfer is successful, the administrator will be notified.

You can [customize the bot's responses](./deploy/example.config.yaml#12), or use default values.
